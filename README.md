# DroneInvasion
Game made in Godot 4.3 Stable
Currently using exclusively GDScript for code and Asset Forge for assets. I will eventually make or commission more permanent art which will also be free to use under MIT.

Feel free to use this code to make your game!

Credit to Kenney for [Asset Forge](https://kenney.nl/tools/asset-forge) which allowed me to make the initial assets
test rules
